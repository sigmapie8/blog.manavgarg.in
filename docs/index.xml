      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;book-review-the-practicing-mind-by-thomas-m-sterner&#34;&gt;Book Review: The Practicing Mind by Thomas M. Sterner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new ritual these days — every time I go to an airport I buy a book and make a promise: the next time I&amp;rsquo;m here I&amp;rsquo;ll have read it. That way I can buy another book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;bania&lt;/em&gt; like me buying books at full price from the airport you ask? It&amp;rsquo;s a perk I get from my new credit card. It helps me shop anything up to INR 1,000 for free at airports. Folks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://apply.scapia.cards/landing_page?referral_code=omlldi&#34;&gt;Scapia&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t know this but they&amp;rsquo;re funding my education these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Product Experience: Mybyk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Dussehra (or Dasara), I found myself in Mysuru, Karnataka, with no uber/ola support and normal autos charging double or triple the usual fare because they could. My savior, a small mobility startup that has a strong presence in Mysuru, or at least I can vouch for the 5km radius around Mysore Palace - &lt;a href=&#34;https://mybyk.in/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MyByk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drew me in was the availability. There was always a bike hub nearby and the prices were affordable. For example, I got an unlimited day pass for ₹85, that would get me a cycle for 24 hours. To my surprise, the cycles were electric, and saved me a lot of pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making Your Agent Wait</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may sound counterintuitive to make an agent wait. After all, we want our agents to be as fast and responsive as possible. However, there are scenarios where a delay is necessary, such as waiting for a long-running process to complete or for data to be returned from a slow API. It has been observed that many AI agents are not designed to handle long delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try the following prompt with your agent:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
