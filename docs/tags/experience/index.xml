      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Dussehra (or Dasara), I found myself in Mysuru, Karnataka, with no uber/ola support and normal autos charging double or triple the usual fare because they could. My savior, a small mobility startup that has a strong presence in Mysuru, or at least I can vouch for the 5km radius around Mysore Palace - &lt;a href=&#34;https://mybyk.in/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MyByk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drew me in was the availability. There was always a bike hub nearby and the prices were affordable. For example, I got an unlimited day pass for ₹85, that would get me a cycle for 24 hours. To my surprise, the cycles were electric, and saved me a lot of pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
